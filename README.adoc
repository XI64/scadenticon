Scadenticon is a identicon generator written in scala . To use :

* Open src/main/scala/prop and change settings in the settings file's field to your liking . Make sure to remove the angular brackets from the username and filename fields.

* Next , open the root folder (scadenticon or scadenticon-master) and type :
----
sbt

* After sbt prompt appears type :

This should make a icon in your project folder. Enjoy !
